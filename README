**DESCRIPTION**
Created back in high school for a PJAS project (read Pennsylvania statewide 
science fair), this C++ program takes highly contrasted waveform-like images, 
converts them to a single line using OpenCV image processing suite, and then 
finds amplitudes of the line and finds corresponding frequency values that 
could be played back as soundwaves.

**INSTALLATION**
If you've made it this far, I commend you. To run this program, you'll need to 
install OpenCV and link it to your IDE as a location to look for header files.
The original package used was version 2.3.0, but any later 2.x version should
be fine. Downloads and instructions can be found at www.opencv.org.

Since this program was never meant to be ran as a standalone item, you'll have to run it through the IDE with the accompanying source file.

**RUNNING THE PROGRAM**
Operation is simple; enter the filepath for your desired converted image.
Hopefully it works. If not, you're free to build a time machine and contact
12th grade me. The chances of me updating this program are incredibly slim
at this point in time. However, I hope you enjoy whatever does come out of
the conversion.

No, this does not play the wavelengths. Yes, I wish it did too.
